## Professional Summary

I am a software developer with a degree in Software Engineering from PUC Campinas and currently pursuing an MBA in Solutions Architecture at FIAP, focused on cloud computing, microservices, and scalable system design.

I work on full stack applications using Vue 3, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and Python (FastAPI), building RESTful APIs, modern web apps, and distributed systems. I have experience with microservices architecture, Docker orchestration, Git versioning, databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, DynamoDB, and Firebase, as well as integrations with services like Form.io, Okta, and Algolia.

I enjoy working in agile environments, with continuous delivery, clean code practices, and collaboration among product, design, and engineering teams. I’m familiar with automated testing (Pytest, Playwright), CI/CD pipelines, and technical documentation with Swagger.

I believe in simple solutions to complex problems, in well-crafted code, and in continuous growth — both technical and personal.
